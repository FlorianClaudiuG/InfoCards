# InfoCards

Year 1 University Programming assignment. Given a Windows Forms framework, we were asked to create additional plugins 
for the existing framework, as well as implement some extra functionality.

Most of my code is inside the InfoCards2 folder.

If downloading the application to test its functionality, note that the downloaded ZIP file needs to be unblocked from
its properties due to it containing several .dll files provided by the lecturer in the framework.
